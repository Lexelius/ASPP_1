Hello my name is Oscar and I am a PhD student in the lab of Johan Elf working on understanding the cell cycle of E. coli with a primary focus on replication initiation control.
We use time-lapse microscopy in combination with microfluidics as our main form of experiments.

Sounds like interesting work!/Robin
